            <h3>The Birth of the Internet: From ARPANET to a Global Revolution</h3>
            <p>Did you know the Internet didn’t just appear overnight? It was developed over decades, starting with ARPANET in the late 1960s. But if you ask Google, you’ll see that the official birthday of the Internet is January 1, 1983. So, why the difference?</p>
            <h4>Before the Internet: How Was Data Shared?</h4>
            <p>Before digital networks, data transfer was a slow and tedious process. If someone needed information, they had two main options:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Physically travel to the source of the data (libraries, universities, or research labs).</li>
                <li>Use magnetic computer tapes to store information and physically transport them—imagine mailing a hard drive instead of sending an email!</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>ARPANET: The First Step Toward the Internet</h4>
            <p>In 1969, the U.S. Department of Defense’s Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) developed ARPANET to create a communication network between distant computers. It was a breakthrough! Instead of relying on direct connections, ARPANET used packet-switching technology—a revolutionary method of breaking data into smaller packets, sending them via multiple routes, and reassembling them at the destination.</p>
            <p>Think of it like a jigsaw puzzle—pieces are scattered, sent through different paths, and reassembled into a complete picture. This method made ARPANET faster, more efficient, and resilient compared to traditional communication systems.</p>
            <h4>So Why Is 1983 the Internet’s Birthday?</h4>
            <p>While ARPANET was a great innovation, it was limited to government agencies, universities, and researchers. Plus, different networks used different communication protocols, making it difficult to connect on a large scale.</p>
            <p>The game-changer arrived on January 1, 1983, when the TCP/IP protocol was officially adopted. This Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) became the universal standard, allowing computers across different networks to communicate seamlessly. This milestone transformed ARPANET into the modern Internet as we know it today.</p>
            <h4>The Legacy of TCP/IP: The Internet We Use Today</h4>
            <p>Even after ARPANET was shut down in 1990, the TCP/IP protocol continued to evolve, forming the backbone of today’s global Internet. It laid the foundation for email, websites, social media, and the digital world we rely on every day.</p>
            <p>So, the next time you browse the web, send a message, or stream a video, remember—you’re using a system built on technology that started over half a century ago!</p>
